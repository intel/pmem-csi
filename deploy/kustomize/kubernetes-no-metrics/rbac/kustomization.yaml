    # PMEM-CSI uses "skip attach" and thus external-provisioner doesn't
    # need to watch VolumeAttachment objects as there never should be
    # any that are relevant for it. We can avoid the overhead (in case
    # other drivers cause the creation of such objects) and potential bugs
    # in Kubernetes (during downgrade testing, "skip attach" did not work
    # properly, potentially because the CSIDriver object wasn't known yet
    # directly after installing the driver).
    #
    # There is currently no command line option to remove the watch,
    # but we can disable it indirectly by removing the RBAC permissions.
    # However, that then triggers some runtime warning.
    #
    # We know that the "volumeattachments" resource is listed as last element.
