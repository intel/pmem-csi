    # For pods with PMEM volumes using late binding, not activating the
    # scheduler extension is okayish (but see https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/544).
    # It's worse for CSI ephemeral volumes because there is no recovery.
    # Nonetheless, failing pod scheduling entirely when PMEM-CSI is down
    # seems worse, so we let the scheduler continue despite failures.
